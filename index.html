                <p>Peachu is a phenomenon</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Every time you sit, she will rest her head on your lap</li>
                    <li>Too happy to see you that she will pee which you have to clean now</li>
                    <li>Belly up and legs apart, snoring like she had a tough day at work</li>
                </ul>
                <p>and that is is the phenomenon of peachu.</p>

                    <li>She struts around the house like she <strong>owns</strong> the placeâ€”and honestly, she does</li>
                    <li>The queen doesn't sit on the couch. She graces it with her presence</li>
                    <li>Sometimes she stares at me like she's judging every single <em>life</em> choice I've ever made</li>
                    <li>Lastly, I am not the one walking her but the other way round and her <strong>smug</strong> face says that she definitely knows it</li>
